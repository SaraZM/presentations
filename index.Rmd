# Linear regression model

The basic linear regression approach is used to model the effect of independent variables on the value of a dependent variable,

$$\boldsymbol{Y} = \boldsymbol{X'}\boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon},$$

where 

--

- $\boldsymbol{Y} = (y_1, \dots , y_n)'$ is a vector of observations,

--
- $\boldsymbol{X}$ is a $n \times k$ matrix of independent variables and an intercept,

--
- $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$ the vector of errors for each observation

--
- and we assume that the errors, $\epsilon_i∼N(0,\tau^2)$ are independent. 

---
# How to accomodate for spatial structure?

- The data usually consist of measurements of $\boldsymbol{X}$ and $\boldsymbol{Y}$ taken at specific locations (s), so we have $Y(s)$ and $X(s)$.

--

- Sometimes, the locations are ignored and other estimation techniques are used to understand the effects of $\boldsymbol{X}$ on $\boldsymbol{Y}$.

--
- How to incorporate the spatial locations into our model?

# Spatial autocorrelation

- Observations that are closer to each other tend to be more alike (**location similarity**).

- We want to account for spatial dependence in the error term and the dependent variable.

- **Spatial autocorrelation** describes the degree to which observations at specific locations are similar to each other. 

- It is necessary to impose sufficient constraints such that a finite number of parameters that characterize the **spatial structure** can be efficiently estimated.

---
# Spatial autocorrelation

- In **geostatistics** the covariance between locations can be expressed as a continuous function of the distance between them, such that,

$$Cov(Y(s_i), Y(s_{i'})) = \sigma^2 \rho(d_{ii'})$$

where $d_{ii'}$ is the distance between the two locations.
--

- So the model becomes, 

$$ Y(s) = \boldsymbol{X'}(s)\boldsymbol{\beta} + \nu(s) + \epsilon(s) ,$$
where  $\epsilon(s) \sim N(0, \tau^2)$  and $\boldsymbol{\nu} = (\nu(s_1),\dots, \nu(s_n))$follows a multivariate normal distribution with mean zero and covariance $\sigma^2\rho(\boldsymbol{d})$.

---

# Spatio-temporal models

- In environmental processes we are not only interested in the spatial structure, but also how this surface changes over time.

--

- Sometimes, ongoing temporal measurements are collected at monitoring sites producing long-time series of data. 

--

- One option is to assume that $Y_t(s)$ is described by a spatio-temporal model of the form,

$$Y_t(s)=\boldsymbol{X_t'}(s)\boldsymbol{\beta_t}(s) + e_t(s)$$

where $\boldsymbol{\beta_t}(s)$ can be constant across time, space, or both. 

The residual $\boldsymbol{e_t}(s)$ can be rewritten as the sum of two independent processes: **white noise** $\boldsymbol{\epsilon_t}(s)$ and a **spatio-temporal process** $\boldsymbol{\omega_t}(s)$.

# Spatio-temporal modelling of pollen concentration in Toronto, Canada 


---

# Motivation

- Little is known about the spatial distribution of pollen concentrations within cities as pollen levels are typically recorded at a single monitoring site.​

  - Weinberger et al., 2018: Intra-urban variation in tree pollen in NYC​

  - Hjort et al., 2016: Land use regression model for grass pollen in the Helsinki area​

- “Epidemiological studies using a single pollen station as a proxy for pollen concentrations are prone to significant measurement error if the study area is climatically variable.” (Katz et al. 2019, Katz and Batterman 2020)​

- Further evidence is needed in order to better establish the spatio-temporal exposure to pollen within a study area​

# Objectives

1. .remark-text[High number of zeros]
  - Because of the seasonality of each type of pollen we need to account for the high number of zeros in the data.

2. .remark-text[Temporal misalignment]
 - Propose a model that accounts for the fact that there are weekly and daily measurements.

#  Objective 1: Account for the high number of zeros


]

---

# Methods

To account for the high number of zeros we propose a Hurdle-log-normal model which is a mixture between a Bernoulli distribution and a log-normal distribution defined as,

$$\begin{split}p(y_t(s) \mid \rho_t(s), \lambda_t(s)) = \begin{cases}
&\rho_t(s) & y_t(s) = 0, \\
&(1−\rho_t(s))p(y_t(s) \mid  \lambda_t(s)) & y_t(s) >  0, \end{cases}\end{split}$$

where $y_t(s)$ is the pollen concentration at week $t$ and location $s$. 

- The positive values follow a lognormal distribution with parameters $\mu_t(s)$ and $\sigma^2$,

$$(y_t(s) \mid \mu_t(s), \sigma^2) \sim lognormal(\mu_t(s), \sigma^2),$$
---

# Methods

Where $\mu_t(s)$ is defined as,


$$\mu_t(s) = \boldsymbol{\alpha}\boldsymbol{x}(s) + \boldsymbol{\beta}\boldsymbol{u_t}(s) + \boldsymbol{\gamma} \boldsymbol{z}_t + \theta_t$$
--

- $\boldsymbol{x}(s)$  is a vector of .remark-text[spatial covariates]

--

- $\boldsymbol{u}_t(s)$ is a vector containing a .remark-text[vegetation] measurement (TC greenness) and a .remark-text[ground composition] measurement (TC brightness) for each site $s$ at each time $t$.

--

- $\boldsymbol{z}_t$ is a vector of .remark-text[weather-related covariates]

--
          		                 	
- $\theta_t$ is a .remark-text[time-varying mean] which will capture the weekly overall temporal mean across sites and it follows

$$\theta_t = \theta_{t-1} + \omega_t , \qquad  \omega_t(s) \sim N(0, W)$$

# Objective 2: Temporal misalignment


]


---

# Methods

Let $\{Y_t(s); s \in \mathbb{R}^d; t = 1,\cdots, T\}$ be a spatio-temporal process such that
$\boldsymbol{Y}_t = (Y_t(s_1), \cdots, Y_t(s_n))'$, we assume that $\boldsymbol{Y}_t \sim N(\boldsymbol{\mu}_t, \boldsymbol{\Sigma})$ where,

$$\boldsymbol{\mu}_t = \bf{F}'_t\boldsymbol{\theta}_t+\boldsymbol{X'\beta}$$
where the state equation is defined as,

$$\boldsymbol{\theta}_t = \bf{G}_t\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t-1} + \boldsymbol{\omega}_t \qquad \boldsymbol{\omega}_t \sim N(0, \boldsymbol{W})$$

--

- $\boldsymbol{F}_t$ is a known $q \times n$ matrix containing temporal covariates,

- $\boldsymbol{G}_t$ is a $q \times q$ evolution matrix,


- $\boldsymbol{X}$ is a matrix containing all land-use covariates and coordinates of the sites,

- $\boldsymbol{\Sigma} = \sigma^2exp(-\boldsymbol{d}/\phi) + \tau^2\boldsymbol{I}$, where $\sigma^2$ is the partial sill, $\phi$ is the spatial range, and $\tau^2$ is the nugget effect.

---

# Methods

Let $\{Y_t(s); s \in \mathbb{R}^d; t = 1,\cdots, T\}$ be a spatio-temporal process such that
$\boldsymbol{Y}_t = (Y_t(s_1), \cdots, Y_t(s_n))'$, we assume that $\boldsymbol{Y}_t \sim N(\boldsymbol{\mu}_t, \boldsymbol{\Sigma})$ where,

$$\boldsymbol{\mu}_t = \bf{F}'_t\boldsymbol{\theta}_t+\boldsymbol{X\beta}$$

Based on conditional independence on $\boldsymbol{Y}_t$, the aggregated measurements are defined as,

$$\boldsymbol{Z}_k = \dfrac{1}{r}\sum^r_{i=1}\boldsymbol{Y}_{rk+i} \sim N\left(\dfrac{1}{r}\sum^r_{i=1}\boldsymbol{\mu}_{rk+i}, \dfrac{1}{r}\boldsymbol{\Sigma}\right)$$

where $\small{\boldsymbol{a^{SU}}_{rk+j} = (\boldsymbol{y^S}_{rk+j},\boldsymbol{z^U}_{k})}$ and $\small{\boldsymbol{\mu^{SU}}_{rk+j} = (\boldsymbol{\mu^S}_{rk+j},\boldsymbol{\eta^U}_{k})}$

# Conclusions

--

- We analyzed spatio-temporal variations in aeroallergen concentrations throughout the pollen season for different types of pollen within a city.

--

- We were able to propose a model to account for the .remark-text[temporal misalignment] in the data.

--

- We estimated the unobserved daily measurements at the weekly sites.

--

- We found different estimates for the fixed effects depending on the .remark-text[temporal scale].

--

- The predicted surfaces will help .remark-text[future epidemiological studies] to find possible associations between pollen levels and some health outcome like respiratory allergies.

# Future work

- .remark-text[Aggregated Hurdle model]:
  1. Is the probability constant or does it change across days?
  2. Is it another hurdle model with different probabilities?
--

- How to account for the temporal misalignment AND the high number of measurements equal to zero at the same time?

# General conclusions

- Hierarchical Bayesian methods can easily accommodate more complex structures when analyzing the distribution of aeroallergens across space and time.

--

- This work shows how by considering a spatial or spatio-temporal structure, it is possible to learn about the spatial patterns and the temporal dynamics of aeroallergens dispersion.
